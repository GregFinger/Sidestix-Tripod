# Sidestix-Tripod

## NOTE: This is currently a work-in-progress

Cinema4D and STL files provided for modification and 3D printing purposes. They can be found in the [models folder](https://github.com/GregFinger/Sidestix-Tripod/tree/master/models).

This consists of two parts, the clip and the legs. The clip has two arc-shaped wings that extend from the clip. Each wing has two small rounded ridges that serve as detents to secure the leg in two positions: retracted and tripod. Retracted means the legs are parallel with the crutch and sit flush against the shaft. Tripod means the legs are in the lowered position and act as two extra feet and assist the crutch with standing upright.

My most recent tests with 3D printing have been with a Creality CR-10S S4 printer, using PLA material and 50% infill (to give the tripod more weight).

### Instructions

M4 bolts and nuts are needed to secure the leg to the clip. The clip should be attached to the lower end of the crutch shaft and 180° directly behind the grip handle is the best. It will take a little force to attach the clip to the crutch. Rubber feet can be glued to the end of the legs for better traction with the ground. Strong glue is recommended. Once attached, the legs can be swivelled between the two positions: retracted and tripod.

In the picture above, the crutch in the middle is in the tripod position. Off to the left side, you can see the other crutch with the legs folded up in the retracted position.

### Notes for Improvements

* The detent system needs some work. The positions are fine, but the leg does not stay solidly secure. The place where the leg splits, for the pivot point, bulges out especially when over one of the detent ridges. The makes for a loose fit on the ridge. It also eventually contributes to the leg getting a permanent deformation on the pivot point, rendering it useless.

* A M4 bolt fits perfectly in the hole of the clip's wing, but for some reason it's snug with the hole in the leg's pivot point. This is an easy modification, just make the hole slightly larger in the model file.

* The M4 bolt is also a bit difficult because the space between the wings (55° angle) is too small to insert the bolts from the middle. If you insert them from the outside, then the space between is too small to fit the M4 nuts in there.

* The clip seems to loosen up over time. It initially is very tight, but seems to loosen up and becomes too easy to slide along the crutch,

* The material used for printing (and even the printing method itself) could be improved. I'm currently using a FBM style printer with PLA material. Both of these are entry level in the realm of 3D printing and should not be used in a professional/commercial environment. Using better materials and better methods might solve some of the above problems.

### Potential Future Modifications

* A trigger system, maybe attached to the handle, so the user doesn't manually have to change the leg between detent positions. 

* A  method where the clip can lock onto the best position along the crutch. Currently trying to get directly 180° behind the grip handle is not easy or convenient.
